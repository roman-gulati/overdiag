# `overdiag` package

A package to investigate empirical estimates of overdiagnosis

This package implements a deterministic model to project disease incidence in
population and trial settings. The projections can be used to examine bias in
empirical estimates of overdiagnosis and/or determine the first time point at
which empirical estimates are unbiased.

To install the `overdiag` package:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('roman-gulati/overdiag')
```
