# overdiag
Project incidence of relevant and overdiagnosed cancers

A deterministic model that can be used to project cancer incidence in population
and trial settings. The projections can be used to examine bias in empirical
estimates of overdiagnosis and/or determine the first time point at which
empirical estimates are unbiased.
